    "Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression technique that is commonly used in machine learning and statistics to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lasso Regression, the goal is to identify a subset of independent variables that are most relevant to the dependent variable, while also minimizing the impact of irrelevant or redundant variables. This is achieved by adding a penalty term to the regression equation that penalizes the coefficients of the independent variables.\n",

    "Compared to other regression techniques like Ridge Regression and Ordinary Least Squares Regression, Lasso Regression has the following unique features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection: Lasso Regression can perform automatic feature selection, which means it can identify the most relevant independent variables and exclude irrelevant or redundant ones from the model. This is particularly useful when dealing with datasets with many independent variables, as it can help reduce overfitting and improve model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shrinking coefficients: In addition to selecting features, Lasso Regression can also shrink the coefficients of the remaining independent variables towards zero. This helps to prevent overfitting and can improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparsity: Lasso Regression produces sparse models, which means that the final model will typically include only a subset of the original independent variables. This can make the model easier to interpret and can help reduce the computational complexity of the model."
